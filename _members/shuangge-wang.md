I'm a first year PhD student at Yale University advised by Brian Scassellati and Tesca Fitzgerald. My research studies human behaviors in a wide variety of human-robot interaction scenarios, such as teaching, learning, and collaboration. Before Yale, I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Southern California.
