I am a first-year Computer Science undergraduate student. My research interests lie in the cross-section of perception and human robot interaction. More specifically, I believe that robust understanding of and reasoning over primarily vision but eventually all sensory inputs is integral to a robot's adaption to novel domains and environments. I also believe that integrating advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence with perceptual systems can significantly enhance the capabilities of robots to interact seamlessly with humans and their surroundings. By leveraging modern learning techniques, we can develop sophisticated models that enable robots to perceive and interpret the world around them in real-time.
